# Discord GPT-4 Bot

This bot is a Python program that uses the Discord API and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create a chat bot in your Discord server. It allows users to interact with the AI by sending chat messages, and the bot will reply using responses generated by GPT-4.

## Features
- Interact with OpenAI's powerful GPT-4 model within Discord.
- Adjustable parameters for more control over the AI's responses (max tokens, temperature).

## Requirements
To run this bot, you need:
- Python 3.6+
- discord.py library
- openai Python library
- OpenAI API key
- Discord bot token

## Installation
1. Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed. If not, download it from the official Python website.

2. Install the required Python libraries with pip:

    ```bash
    pip install discord.py openai
    ```

3. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord_gpt-4_bot.git
    ```

4. Enter your OpenAI API key and Discord bot token in the respective placeholder fields in the code.

## Usage
1. Start the bot:

    ```bash
    python discord_gpt-4_bot.py
    ```

2. Once the bot is running and connected to your Discord server, you can use the command `!chat` followed by your message to interact with the AI. For example:

    ```bash
    !chat Hello, how are you?
    ```

    The bot will reply to your message with a response generated by the GPT-4 model.

3. You can control the length and randomness of the AI's response by adjusting the `max_tokens` and `temperature` parameters:

    ```bash
    !chat How's the weather today? --max_tokens 50 --temperature 0.5
    ```

    - `max_tokens` (default: 1500): Controls the maximum length of the AI's response.
    - `temperature` (default: 1): Controls the randomness of the AI's response. Higher values (closer to 1) make the output more random, while lower values (closer to 0) make it more deterministic.
